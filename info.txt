#
# Each lemma#PoS in this file is associated with the prior polarity value computed from the scores of 
# all the SentiWordNet senses for that lemma#PoS, following the methodology described in Guerini et al. (2013). 
# Prior Polarity values are between -1 (very negative) and +1 (very positive).

TAG SET

----------------------------------------------------------------
The set of POS tags used here is a modified version of the
Penn Treebank tagset. Tags with non-letter characters have been 
redefined to work better in our data structures. Also, the 
``Determiner'' tag (DET) has been changed from `DT', in order to
avoid confusion with the HTML tag, <DT>.
